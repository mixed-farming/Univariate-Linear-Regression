# Univariate-Linear-Regression

## Problem statement
Linear Regression is implemented to identify the relationship between profit of a bike sharing company and population of different cities. The main objective is to find the next city in which a new outlet should be opened which results in optimal profitability.

## Implementation
- Application of the cost function as shown below:

- Implementation of gradient descent algorithm from scratch in Python without the use of machine learning frameworks such as scikit-learn and statsmodels. Ran the algorithm over 2000 iterations to minimize the cost J(Œ∏). With each step of batch gradient descent, the parameters ùúÉ_j come closer to the optimal values that will achieve the lowest cost J(ùúÉ).
